Playn was supposed to be a non-bloated minimalistic (in feature as well) android media player. I had plans bigger than my head so for the sake of... my life i quit this project. Perhaps if someone is doing something similair they may find useful stuff in here, though i admit its very hard to digest. or maybe someones just interested in how a dead app in alpha from 24 looks like. should be compileable no problem. adieu
